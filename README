Soloed as team "This can't possibly be the end of the wo-"

Ranked 55th out of 219 teams after the final round, with 15683 points (best
being 294024).

Round 1: Ranked 25th, with 9490 points (best being 10956).
Round 2: Ranked 44th, with 15096 points (best being 21609).

My lightning round submission pretty much bombed, as it only managed to solve
the very first map, and even then suboptimally, scoring a whopping 210 points
and placing 82th, just above the last person to finish with a positive score
(there were a few others who finished in the negative). At least mine was
smart enough to avoid killing itself. This result is rather unsurprising, as
the only thing I had working at that point was the game engine, and the policy
wasn't far removed from a random walk.

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my performance. I played solo this year, and
I only spent around 24 hours on the problem over the three days (the
theoretical maximum is 72 hours, but practically speaking it's possible to
put around 50 to 60 hours into it without driving oneself into slackjawed
exhaustion). So my goals were quite modest: implement all the game rules
correctly, abort sensibly (instead of dying), pass to round 2. I achieved all
of that and even passed to the final round, which was unexpected.

My implementation is quite brain-dead. It's a local search largely unaware of
global situation (except for some trivial heuristics). I dismissed
straightforward A* almost immediately, as it blows in dynamic environments,
and moving stones lead to rather drastic combinatorial explosion if approached
naively, so I put pathfinding on my 'to-do-if-I-have-time-for-it-which-I-won't'
list and concentrated on brute force local search.

The algorithm does not discount future gains (as I put 3/2 instead of 2/3 as a
discounting factor, got rather shocking results, and never figured out the bug
during the contest), and so it's as happy to hang around lambdas as to
actually eat them. Curiously, this turned out to be quite advantageous, as it
added a dash of non-determinism to the algo which apparently helped it solve
some maps it couldn't with proper discounting.

Naturally, the algo tends to get stuck in local maxima. As a way around that I
implemented a 'pheromonal bomb' which allows the robot to leave a temporary
'stinky patch' wherever it hangs around for a long time. This isn't as good an
idea as it might sound, as the robot usually starts oscillating between two
nearby local maxima as a result. Furthermore, the implementation is buggy, as
it happens. I meant the bomb to be a purely local effect, but it actually
affects the entire field.

Nonetheless, the resulting artificial moron performed surprisingly well on
small maps, and using repeated searches it could often find quite decent
solutions. I got a bit lucky in the first round in that my algo performed
better on a few maps than it would on an average 120 seconds run (the algo
being non-deterministic). This got compensated in round two, where it actually
performed worse than on an average run.

The algo completely bombed in the final round. I never got around to
optimizing my game engine, so the simulation performance totally sucks on
large maps. I still scored a few points, but only a tiny fraction of what
would be possible with a more efficient engine (even using the same brain-dead
algo).
